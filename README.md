# Optimized-Bayesian-Nonlocal-means-with-block-OBNLM-
Optimized bayesian nonlocal-means algorithm for denoising ultrasound image

# Description
- BayesianNLM.m : the OBNLM algorithm
- getPearsonDistance.m: compute the pearson distance based bayesian framework
- ImgNormalize.m: pre-processing the image (histogram stretching) 
- testBayesianNLM.m: test our algorithm using the input (noisyImage.png) and get the output (despeckledImage.png)
